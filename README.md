# **Customer Churn Analysis**

### **One-line Summary:**

Predicting customer churn to help businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

## **Overview**

Customer churn is when customers stop using a companyâ€™s products or services. Understanding the patterns behind churn can help businesses take proactive measures to retain customers. This project analyzes customer data, builds predictive models, and visualizes insights for better decision-making.

## **Problem Statement**

The objective of this project is to predict which customers are likely to churn and understand the key factors influencing churn. This allows businesses to take corrective actions to retain valuable customers.

## **Dataset**

The dataset contains customer information such as demographics, account details, subscription type, and usage patterns. It includes features like:

* CustomerID
* Age, Gender
* Tenure
* Service usage (e.g., calls, data usage)
* Billing information
* Churn (target variable)

**Source:** \[Add dataset source here]

## **Tools & Technologies**

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
* **Visualization Tools:** Power BI / Tableau (if applicable)
* **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## **Methods**

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding distributions, correlations, and churn patterns.
3. **Model Building:**

   * Logistic Regression
   * Decision Trees / Random Forest
   * XGBoost / Gradient Boosting
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

## **Key Insights**

* High tenure and engagement are associated with lower churn.
* Certain services/features show strong correlation with churn.
* Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to leave.
* Demographic factors like age and region may influence churn patterns.

## **Dashboard / Models / Outputs**

* Interactive dashboards showing churn distribution, top factors, and customer segmentation.
* Predictive models that classify customers as likely-to-churn or not.
* Visual outputs highlighting trends and patterns for business decisions.

## **How to Run This Project?**

1. Clone this repository:

git clone [repository-url]

2. Install required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open `Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all cells to preprocess data, train models, and generate visualizations.
5. Optionally, open `Dashboard.html` for interactive visualization.

## **Results & Conclusion**

* The best model achieved **\[insert metrics, e.g., 85% accuracy, 0.78 ROC-AUC]**.
* Key churn drivers identified include tenure, monthly charges, and service usage.
* Businesses can target at-risk customers with retention strategies based on these insights.

## **Future Work**

* Incorporate more features such as customer feedback and engagement scores.
* Experiment with deep learning models for improved prediction accuracy.
* Build a real-time dashboard for continuous churn monitoring.
